  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.onewayportal": "Accepts a Vector for the portal spawn, one for output, a third for rotation, and a number for the size. This is unfortunately quite expensive due to the balance of media, costing 64 charged amethyst per size given",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.twowayportal": "Accepts a Vector for a portal side, another one for the other portal side, a third for rotation, and a number for the size. This is much cheaper then 1 Way Portals, costing only 16 charged amethyst per size given",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.summonscry": "Works like a 1 way portal, but I seem to not be able to travel through it. However I dont have to find a scroll for it, much cheaper too, costs about 4 shards",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.moveportalinput": "Takes a portal entity and a location vector, and relocates the side you are looking at to that vector. This is perfect for moving portals I have missed placed. Costs 8 dust",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.moveportaloutput": "Takes a portal entity and a location vector, and relocates the output/opposite side to that vector. I hypothesis that this can be quite strong with Portal Ambit. Costs 16 dust",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.removeportal": "Remove Portal takes a portal entity, and closes the Portal pair, perfect for when the portal is slowing down reality, or if I just don't want a portal anymore. Costs 2 dusts",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.portalambit": "Seems like through strange forces, Ambit leaks through portals, albeit, half as strong as when it goes it",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.setportalsides": "As much as I love the Hexagons, they don't fit every situation. So I can change the amount of sides of a portal with this, it seems like it rounds the number I feed it. Costs 10 shards",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.resizeportal": "I have reasons for not wanting to use normal shapes (even just to mess with other people). By giving a hight and a width I may change the size of the portal, it does change it to a hexagon though. Costs 16 shards",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.getoutputinfo": "This nifty little pattern return ether the portal's output portal, or the vector of the portal. This could be useful combined with Portal Ambit. It has not cost as far as I can tell, strange",
  "portalhexaddon.page.hexways.rotateportal": "I have rotated my placement wrong, luckily, I can use this spell to change the rotation of the portal. However it rotates both pairs of portals... Costs 2 dust, strangely cheap, I should take use of that",
